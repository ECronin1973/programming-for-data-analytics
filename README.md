This was useful for accessing and printing data in Part A, and for understanding how to loop through and filter data in Part B.

- **JSON Format – json.org**  
  I used [json.org](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) to learn the basic structure of JSON, including how data is stored in key-value pairs and nested lists. This helped me understand how to navigate and compare JSON structures across different UK regions.

- **gov.uk Bank Holidays API**  
  I explored the [gov.uk bank holidays JSON feed](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.json) to see how the data is organized and where to find the holidays for Northern Ireland, England and Wales, and Scotland. This was essential for comparing holiday titles and identifying which ones are unique to Northern Ireland in Part B.

- **Python Requests Library**  
  I read the [requests library documentation](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) to understand how to fetch data from a website using Python. This was used to retrieve the JSON data needed for both parts of the assignment.

- **W3Schools – Python JSON Tutorial**  
  I used [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_json.asp) to learn how to convert JSON into Python dictionaries and loop through the data. This helped with extracting and comparing holiday titles across regions.

- **Real Python – API Guide**  
  I read [Real Python’s API guide](https://realpython.com/api-integration-in-python/) to learn good practices for working with APIs, including how to handle errors, validate responses, and format output clearly. This was especially helpful in making the script more robust and readable for both parts of the assignment.

## 🏛️ Assignment 03 – Email Domain Analysis (Pie Chart)

This notebook explores a dataset of 1,000 individuals to identify and visualise the most common email domains. It demonstrates how to extract domain names from email addresses, compute frequency counts, and generate a pie chart using Python libraries. Less frequent domains are grouped into an “Others” category to improve readability and visual clarity.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this notebook, users will learn to:

- Load and inspect structured CSV data using pandas
- Extract domain names from email addresses using string operations
- Count domain frequencies and group low-frequency entries
- Generate and save a pie chart visualisation using matplotlib and seaborn

---

## 📁 Source Files

| File Path | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `assignments/notebooks/assignment03-pie.ipynb` | Main notebook for Assignment 03. Loads the dataset, extracts email domains, counts them, and creates a pie chart. |
| `assignments/data/people.csv` | Dataset of 1,000 individuals. The `Email` column is used to extract domain names. |

---

## 🧭 Implementation Approach

The notebook is implemented in modular steps:

---

### 1. **Load Dataset**
- Read `people.csv` into a pandas DataFrame
- Confirm presence of the `Email` column

**Why:**  
Loading the dataset into a DataFrame enables efficient manipulation and analysis. Verifying structure ensures robustness before processing.  
🔗 [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

---

### 2. **Extract Email Domains**
- Split each email address at the `@` symbol
- Retain the domain portion (e.g. `example.org`)

**Why:**  
Domain extraction is a common string operation in data cleaning. It enables grouping by organisation or provider.  
🔗 [Python string methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)

---

### 3. **Count Domain Frequencies**
- Use `value_counts()` to tally domain occurrences
- Identify top domains and group others

**Why:**  
Frequency counts reveal dominant providers. Grouping less frequent domains into “Others” improves visual clarity.  
🔗 [pandas Series.value_counts](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.value_counts.html)

---

### 4. **Generate Pie Chart**
- Plot top domains using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Style chart for accessibility and save as JPG

**Why:**  
Pie charts are effective for showing proportional distribution. Saving the chart ensures reproducibility and supports reviewer access.  
🔗 [matplotlib pie chart guide](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/pie_and_polar_charts/pie_features.html)

---

### 5. **Run the Notebook**

To execute the notebook:

```bash
cd assignments/notebooks
jupyter notebook assignment03-pie.ipynb
```

# 📊 Assignment 05 – Population Analysis by Sex and Age

This assignment explores population data by sex and single year of age using official census statistics. It demonstrates how to clean, transform, and analyse demographic data using Python and pandas, with a strong emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and pedagogical structure.

## Task A: 
Write a jupyter notebook that analyses the differences between the sexes by age in Ireland. 
- Weighted mean age (by sex) 
- The difference between the sexes by age 

This part does not need to look at the regions.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This notebook will:

- Load and clean raw CSV data using pandas
- Pivot data to compare population counts by sex across age groups
- Compute weighted statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Visualise distributions using parametric bell curves and kernel density estimation (KDE)
- Export analysis-ready tables for downstream use or review

## 📁 Source File

This notebook is located at:  
[assignment05-population.ipynb](https://github.com/ECronin1973/programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/assignments/notebooks/assignment05-population.ipynb)

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

The raw dataset is cleaned by:

- Dropping metadata columns not required for analysis
- Filtering to retain only 'Male' and 'Female' rows
- Standardising age labels (e.g. converting 'Under 1 year' to `0`)
- Removing non-numeric age entries and converting types
- Ensuring all population counts are integers

## 📈 Pivot Table Creation

A pivot table is created with:

- Rows: Single year of age
- Columns: Sex ('Male', 'Female')
- Values: Population counts

This structure allows for direct comparison of male and female population counts across age groups.

## 🧮 Statistical Analysis

The notebook computes:

- **Weighted Mean Age**: Average age weighted by population count
- **Weighted Standard Deviation**: Spread of ages around the weighted mean
- **Weighted Median Age**: Age at which half the population is younger and half is older

Each statistic is calculated per sex and saved to CSV for reproducibility.

## 🔍 KDE and Bell Curve Visualisation

Two visualisations are provided:

- **Parametric Bell Curve**: Approximates a normal distribution using weighted mean and standard deviation
- **Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)**: Smoothed density based on actual age counts, without assuming normality

Plots are saved as PNG files and designed for clarity and accessibility.

### Visual outputs

Below are the two main plot outputs produced by the notebook (also saved to `assignments/data/`). These images are embedded here so reviewers can see the results without opening the notebook.

![Parametric bell curves (approx normal) - assignment 05](assignments/data/assignment-05-age-bell-curve.png)

_Parametric bell curves generated using the weighted mean (μ) and weighted standard deviation (σ) for each sex. Useful for a concise, parametric comparison but assumes normality._

![Weighted KDE of age by sex - assignment 05](assignments/data/assignment-05-age-kde.png)

_Weighted KDE computed from the single-year age counts; this non-parametric curve reveals the actual shape of the distribution (skew, modes, tails) that a simple bell curve may miss._

Interpretation (short): use the KDE as the primary visual check for the real distribution shape; use the bell-curve as a compact parametric summary. If the KDE shows strong skew or multiple peaks, prefer the KDE for interpretation and reporting.

## 📊 Age Difference Analysis

The notebook also computes:

- Absolute difference in population count between sexes at each age
- Which sex has a greater count at each age ('Male', 'Female', or 'Equal')

This is exported to `age_difference_by_sex.csv` and supports further visualisation or reporting.

## ✅ Reviewer Notes

- All outputs are saved to disk for reproducibility
- Data types are explicitly coerced before saving
- Sanity checks are included after each major transformation
- Comments are written to support user learning
- Notebook structure is modular and easy to follow
